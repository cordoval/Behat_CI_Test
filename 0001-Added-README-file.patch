+Folks,
+
+I have been using Behat version 1 to succesfully instantiate and extend
+a CodeIgniter controller and test different methods in the controller.
+When I have tried the doing this with Behat version 2, Behat dies with
+with the php error message:
+
+PHP Fatal error: Call to a member function set_userdata() on a non-
+object in …
+
+the mentioned function is a method of the CodeIngniter session class
+library.
+
+I am trying to instantiate the test controller that extends the
+CodeIgniter controller in the bootstrap/FeatureContext.php file.
+
+Now the interesting thing is that the object is instantiated and the
+session method can be accessed before Behat begins running/parsing
+through the story. I can error_log session variables, etc. but once it
+starts to print the story the object somehow gets stomped on and it
+dies with the above error message.
+
+To summarize, my FeatureContext constructor instantiates my test
+controller, i.e:
+
+public function __construct(array $parameters)
+{
+  // Initialize your context here
+  $this->controller = new testController();
+
+}
+
+my test controller (which extends the CodeIgniter controller) invokes
+the parent::__construct() method, the session data is printed by the
+MVC controller, Behat starts to print out “Feature: …”, the MVC
+Controller prints out empty session data, and then Behat dies with
+above fatal error.
+
+So it appears that somewhere between when the time the original
+CodeIgniter constructor is called and the time Behat starts to parse
+the story, the CodeIgniter constructor gets clobbered somehow.
+
+Any help, pointers, etc. would be greatly appreciated. I have truly
+enjoyed working with Behat v1 and really want to get up to speed with
+your current version.
+
+Thank you, and Best Regards,
+
+Daryl
